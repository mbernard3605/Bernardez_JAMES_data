          Version 1 of CSU array-averaged analysis products (This is a not a final dataset). 

          Release date: 7 August 2013

          (Note: All versions released prior to this date from our CSU group should be referred to
           as Version 0 which was based on a mixture of partially corrected hi-res sonde data 
           and GTS-resolution uncorrected data.)

          Array-averaged analysis included: 
             - basic fields (z, u, v, omega, T, theta, q, rh, div, vort as a function of pressure) 
             - large-scale forcing fields (i.e., advective tendencies of T and q) 
             - Q1 and Q2 (i.e., apparent heat source and moisture sink)
             - surface fluxes (latent and sensible heat, daily-resolution, from WHOI)
             - budget-derived rainfall (based on Q2-budget)
             - TRMM 3-hrly rainfall estimates (based on 3B42v7 product)

          Time period: 1 October - 31 Decemeber 2011,  6-hr resolution unless noted otherwise

          Vertical resolution: 25-hPa

          Averaging areas: 
             - Northern Sounding Array (NSA) bounded by core sites (Male, Colombo, Gan, Revelle) 
             - Southern Sounding Array (SSA) bounded by core sites (Mirai, Gan, Diego, Revelle) 
             - Figure "dynamo_map.png" shows averaging array and sonde network 

This dataset version used no supplemental model data in data sparse regions 
               (i.e., neither inside nor outside of enhanced sounding arrays).  
             - hi-res sonde data was used at the following core sites (Male, Gan, Diego, Revelle, 
               Mirai, Colombo) and 12 other Piority Sounding Sites (See Ciesielski et al. 2013)
             - humidity corrected (Level 3) data were used for the six core sites, however 
               humidity corrections were not yet available for the 12 Meisei sonde sites 
               over Indonesia at the time this version of the dataset was prepared. 
             - hi-res P3 dropsonde data were used
             - GTS-resolution sonde data were used at 54 other sites
             - V1 analyses are available every 6 hours, future versions will be created at 3 hr resolution
             - Ciesielski et al. (2013) describes the sonde data used and their corrections  
             - Johnson and Ciesielski (2013) describes analysis procedure and some preliminary findings

             - caveats:  Because of the large station spacing between sites over the Northern 
                         Sounding Array, the strong diurnal cycle and flow-blocking at low-levels 
                         at Colombo are aliased onto the large-scale analyses and adversely affect 
                         the large-scale budgets. This version of the analysis includes a preliminary 
                         attempt to adjust low-level fields in Colombo sonde data to mute these effects. 
                         This is a work in progress and details of this adjustment and its 
                         impact on the budgets are forthcoming. 
                        -while analyses are provide from 1 Oct to 31 Dec, keep in mind the following:
                         - analyses are most reliable when ships are on-site:
                           - Revelle was onsite (nominal position 80.5E,Eq.) from 4 Oct - 29 Oct, 
                             10 Nov. - 04 Dec., and 18 Dec. - 31 Dec.
                           - Mirai was on site (nominal position 80.5E,8S) from 1 Oct - 24 Oct. 
                             and 1 Nov - 27 Nov. 
                         - analyses over NSA are less reliable after 12/05 when Colombo went from
                           4/day to 1/day sonde observations.
                         - Male' ended sonde operation on 15 December 2011 at 00Z so in effect there 
                           was no NSA after this date.
                         - see figure "invent_vis.png" which shows a visual inventory of soundings for 6 core 
                           Indian Ocean sites (Fig. 2 of Ciesielski et al. 2013) 

              - (for internal use only: V1 analyses is based on gridded analysis version 8a)

These data products were created by objectively analyzing upper-air sonde data onto a regular 1-degree, 
25-hPa grid using multiquadric interpolation.  The gridded data fields were then averaged over the 
Northern Sounding Array (NSA) and Southern Sounding Arrays (SSA). As discussed in Johnson and Ciesielski 2013
the NSA analyses were strongly modulated by MJO signal while SSA analyses were modulated more by ITCZ convection.

******** format for fields.nsa_ver or fields.ssa_ver: BASIC fields

for each 6 hour period there is one line with date/time information followed by 
41 lines with data as a function of pressure

order of fields and their units are given below

 yy mm dd hh
    p          z        u        v      omega     T       theta     wmr     rh        div      vort
    hPa        m       m/s       m/s     mb/hr    C        K        g/kg     (%)     x10^6s-1  x10^5s-1


to convert omega (mb/hr) to w (mm/s) use the following approximate eqn: omega/(-g*rho) = w 

g = 9.8 m/s
rho = p/RT can be computed from fields provided (for example near 1000 mb, rho  ~ 1.15 kg/m^3, 
                                                             near  100 mb, rho  ~ 0.18 kg/m^3)

So that 1 mb/hr is ~2.5 mm/s  near 1000 mb, while 1 mb/hr near 100 mb is ~16 mm/s 


******* format for lsf.nsa_ver or lsa.ssa_ver: LARGE-SCALE FORCING fields

File "lsf.nsa_ver" contains 368 periods of six-hourly forcing data (01 Oct - 31 Dec 2011).
For each six hour period there are 41 lines of data.

Line 1 contains: [year, month, day, hour]
                 written with format (4i3)
Lines 2-42 contain: [p(mb), hT(C/s), vT(C/s), hq(gr/(kg*s)), vq(gr/(kg*s))]
                          written with format (f8.2,1p,8e11.3)
                          where hT - horizontal advection of T
                          where vT -   vertical advection of T
                          where hq - horizontal advection of q
                          where vq -   vertical advection of q

These horizontal and vertical advection terms were computed using centered differences as follows:

horizontal advection of "f": h(f) = u*df/dx + v*df/dy
                      where: dx = a cos(phi)*d(lambda)
                             dy = a d(phi)
                             phi    - latitiude
                             lambda - longitude
vertical advection of "f": v(f) = omega*df/dp

Note: vt is only part of vertical temperture forcing (vtf)
      vtp = (p/po)**cappa * omega * d(theta)/dp = omega * (dT/dp - alpha/cp),  
                                                 where alpha is specific volume
      alpha = RT/p can be computed from basic fields

The apparent heat source, Q1, and moisture sink, Q2 (Yanai et al. 1973)
were computed as:

Q1/cp = [dT/dt + h(T) + (p/po)**kappa * omega * d(theta)/dp]
Q2/cp = -Lv/cp * [dq/dt + h(q) + v(q)]
      where dt = 12 hours
            po = 1000 mb
